  What is it?
  -----------

  nyxIn, or nyxIntegrated, is a gallery plugin that is designed to 
  blend into a website by adapting most of the website's existing CSS
  file. The gallery itself is dynamic due to the use of Ajax and
  features an easy drag and drop upload process (credited to Andrew
  Valums). It has an incredibly easy installation process and during
  development, was tested on various free CSS templates found online
  in order to ensure it's quality and compatibility.
