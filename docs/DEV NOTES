  What is it?
  -----------

  This file includes several important notes about how nyxIn works and is
  intended for developers who wish to build upon or customize nyxIn.
  Although you may choose to not follow the conventions used by nyxIn, 
  however, it is recommended as it keeps the code consistent and decreases
  the chance of nyxIn affecting the website due to variable name clashes.

  Ajaxed Files
  ------------
  ----------------------------
  | nyxIn/ajax.php           |
  | nyxIn/index.php          |
  | nyxIn/main.php           |
  | nyxIn/core/functions.php |
  ----------------------------
  ----------------------------
  These files are either Ajaxed into the actual website, 'require'd by the
  actual website, or are important to that process. The code here should be
  kept consistent in order to minimize the chance of a variable name collision
  and it is also a good habit to keep everything consistent.

  These files are independent of the actual website, so there is no need to 
  place prefixes in front of the variable names. A page and an action are
  declared using GET and the files inside in nyxIn/admin/ validate specific,
  expected inputs, so there will never be unintended conflicts.
